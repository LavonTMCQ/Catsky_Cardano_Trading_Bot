## 🛠️ Key Technical Changes

### 1. Lucid Initialization
```diff
- const lucid = await Lucid.new(provider, network);
+ const lucid = await getBackendBlockfrostLucidInstance(networkId, projectId, url, address);
```

### 2. Transaction Signing
```diff
- const txHash = await tx.sign().complete().submit();
+ const signedTx = txComplete.sign();
+ const completedTx = await signedTx.commit();
+ const txHash = await completedTx.submit();
```

### 3. Package Usage
```diff
- import { Lucid, Blockfrost, Data } from "lucid-cardano";
+ import { getBackendBlockfrostLucidInstance } from "@minswap/sdk";
```
